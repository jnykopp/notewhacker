* Notewhacker

  A game for learning sheet music notation.

  Connect your General Midi-enabled musical instrument of choice to
  your computer. Start Notewhacker and try to hit your instrument's
  keys matching the notes scrolling on a staff on your screen.

  2024-05-03, version 0.0.5 (See [[CHANGELOG.org]])

* Installing and running

  Download the software (e.g. clone from git).

  Easiest way to get the software running is to use [[http://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]]:
  - Install Quicklisp, if not installed already. (Rest of the steps
    assume it'll be installed to default directory =~/quicklisp=.)
  - Copy or move the =notewhacker= directory into quicklisp's
    local-projects directory =~/quicklisp/local-projects=.
  - Run in Lisp repl =(ql:quickload "notewhacker")=. This will
    automatically download and compile the dependencies and compile
    Notewhacker.
  - Start the program with ~(notewhacker:main)~.
    - Notewhacker tries to guess the midi instrument. If you use [[https://jackaudio.org/][JACK]],
      you need to connect your instrument to Notewhacker, e.g.  with
      ~qjackctl~. If you use OSS, you may need to set
      ~*midi-device-pathname*~ to the path to the midi device of your
      choice (e.g. =/dev/midi4=).
  - After initial installation, you can load Quicklisp in your Lisp
    repl with ~(load "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp")~ before loading
    Notewhacker, e.g. in SBCL:
  : $ sbcl
  : ...
  : * (load "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp")
  : T
  : * (ql:quickload "notewhacker")
  : ...
  : ("notewhacker")
  : * (notewhacker:main)

** System requirements

   - Reasonably recent Linux operating system (might work on other
     Unixes too, incl. MacOS, and maybe even on Windows)
     - Audio:
       - Either [[https://jackaudio.org][JACK]] (or [[https://pipewire.org/][Pipewire]] which is default in modern Linux)
       - Or [[http://www.opensound.com/][OSS]] or [[http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page][ALSA]] with OSS emulation turned on
     - [[http://www.libsdl.org/][Simple Directmedia Layer]] version 2.0 system library
   - OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card and drivers
     - Related libraries for Linux
   - [[http://ccl.clozure.com/][Clozure Common Lisp]] or [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]] implementation of Common Lisp
   - General Midi compatible musical instrument or some such
     - For quick testing a virtual keyboard like [[https://github.com/tiwai/vkeybd][vkeybd]] is sufficient

** Changing the visible staffs and midi channels

   - To e.g. remove the staff with the f-clef (ùÑ¢) modify file
     =notewhacker.lisp= function =gen-game-loop= by removing the
     s-expression starting =(f-staff (make-instance...=.
   - By default g-clef (ùÑû) only matches events in midi channel 0 and
     f-clef (ùÑ¢) events in channel 1. To change both recognize all
     channels, change in the aforementioned file and function the
     lines with =:midi-channel 0= and =:midi-channel 1= both to
     =:midi-channel nil=.

** Keyboard control (mostly for testing or debugging)

   - On (Finnish/Swedish) QWERTY keyboard key =C= corresponds to C4
     note, =F= to C4 sharp etc. When hit while holding left shift they
     generate midi channel 1 events, channel 0 otherwise. For testing
     purposes; game can't be played reasonably using keyboard.

** Getting sound out from your controller

   Notewhacker doesn't output sound by itself but assumes your
   instrument generates sound.

   However, some MIDI controller keyboards do not have their own tone
   generators but rely on another MIDI device (e.g. a computer) to
   produce sound.

   One solution to hear the notes you play in Notewhacker is that you
   could start a software synthesizer like e.g. [[https://www.fluidsynth.org/][fluidsynth]] and route
   the MIDI data to both Notewhacker and the software synth.
   Preferred way to do this is to utilize Notewhacker's [[http://jackaudio.org/][JACK]]
   interface, as JACK makes routing very easy.

*** MIDI routing on OSS only system

    If, however, you need to use OSS only, I implemented a MIDI-thru
    system. To enable it, first create a FIFO with terminal command:
    : mkfifo $HOME/midi-thru

    (Or if you want to change the FIFO's name, modify also the
    ~*midi-thru-pathname*~ variable in =oss-midi.lisp=.)

    Then add ~:notewhacker-midi-thru~ to ~*FEATURES*~ and compile
    Notewhacker again; i.e. do the following in your Lisp repl:
    : * (pushnew :notewhacker-midi-thru *features*)
    : ... [some output which depends on your system] ...
    : * (asdf:load-system :notewhacker :force t)
    : ... [lots of output] ...

    Then, install a software synthesizer, e.g. fluidsynth (and some
    soundfonts). Start it and force it to use OSS:
    : fluidsynth -a oss -m oss -o midi.oss.device=$HOME/midi-thru /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2

    (The ~/usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2~ part depends on where
    you have the soundfonts installed.)

    If you're running on a system with PulseAudio, you may need to run:
    : padsp fluidsynth -a oss -m oss -o midi.oss.device=$HOME/midi-thru /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2

    (Or if on a system with Alsa, replace ~padsp~ with ~ossd~.)

    To get a graphical UI, you can replace ~fluidsynth~ with ~qsynth~
    in the commands above.

    Then start Notewhacker normally and enjoy the sounds! (You can use
    normal program change controls to choose different General Midi
    instruments; all data is routed through the MIDI-thru, not just
    the messages Notewhacker understands.)

* To do

  - More intelligence to target chord creation.
    - User configurable note range.
    - Reasonable chords. Now they are totally random within a certain
      predetermined range.
    - Learning: generate target notes which player finds difficult
      more often.
  - Key signature changes during game.
  - Accordion-mode (Handling Stradella Bass System).
  - Reading target notes from a midi file to enable practising a
    piece.

* Known bugs

  On some graphics cards all of the textures have a thin transparent
  line going across them. This happens e.g. on Nvidia Quadro NVS
  4200M. The software was developed using Intel HD4000 graphics card,
  and VirtualBox with Windows host OS and Intel HD 530 graphics card,
  which don't expose this bug.
