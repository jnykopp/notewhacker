* Changelog

** 0.0.5 (2024-05-03)
   - Jack MIDI in support.

** 0.0.4 (2024-03-28)
   - Implemented resizeable screen.

** 0.0.3 (2017-12-30)
   - With current lispbuilder-sdl, cl-opengl and SDL1.2 system
     library, both CCL (1.11.5) and SBCL (1.4.2) crashed with floating
     point exceptions. Since SDL1.2 is "historic" according to SDL
     home page and lispbuilder-sdl is using SDL1.2, I decided to move
     on to cl-sdl2 and SDL2 system library. I modified Notewhacker in
     the most straightforward way to use cl-sdl2 and SDL2.

** 0.0.2 (2014-07-31)
   - Added support for multiple staffs.
   - Added C-clef support.
   - Keyboard can now be used for hitting certain range of notes. 

** 0.0.1 (2013-09-30)
   - First public release.
